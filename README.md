# Algorithms-Ntua
Git repository for course: "Algorithms and complexity" of NTUA ECE School.
Course is currently in the 7th semester.

Professor: [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/)

### Structure

- [Graptes](https://github.com/steliostss/Algorithms-Ntua/tree/master/Graptes) include all theoretical exercises, either explained with text or pseudo code. Each algorithm is defined with at least three (3), at most four (4) points:
  - Description
  - Complexity
  - Correctness
  - Examples
- [Programmatistikes](https://github.com/steliostss/Algorithms-Ntua/tree/master/Programmatistikes) include lab exercises, written in C++. Each assignments ([ask1](https://github.com/steliostss/Algorithms-Ntua/tree/master/Programmatistikes/ask1), [ask2](https://github.com/steliostss/Algorithms-Ntua/tree/master/Programmatistikes/ask2), [ask3](https://github.com/steliostss/Algorithms-Ntua/tree/master/Programmatistikes/ask3)) includes at least two (2) exercises, thus the sub-folders. Each sub-folder includes input and corresponding output files and the source code.
